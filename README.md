# RedirectManagerWithQueryStrings
Sitecore redirectmanager modified to support querystring handling

This is the author of the original module

And his work is still on codeplex.

A couple years ago when this thing was added to a Sitecore instance I work on, I realized it really
needed to be able to deal with querystrings as well as the redirects themselves. So I did that!
